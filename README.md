## Welcome!

Welcome to my peronal GitHub page! I'll be perfectly frank and say I have no idea what I'm doing with this page, or really how to use markdown, so a lot of the stuff on here is me messing around with it. 

My background is in Stats and Finance, as I'm currently completing my Bachelor in both of them at the University of Calgary. Over the last few years I've learned how to code in R, Python3, T-SQL, and some VBA, but please never ask me to look at it, as I despise that language...

## What I'm Currently working on...

A lot of my time is being spent on data visualisation, and how companies can use it to improve data literacy, and allow for data driven decision making throughout the organization. [Big Data Baseball: Math, Miracles, and the End of a 20-Year Losing Streak by Travis Sawchik](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22895690-big-data-baseball "Big Data Baseball: Math, Miracles, and the End of a 20-Year Losing Streak") provides some really good anecdotes on this idea, and how in a very old school clubhouse, the Pittsburgh Pirates were able to embrace this philosphy, and proceeded to have their first winning season in 20 years. I'd highly recommend it to baseball fans, or people looking at adopting this idea.

I'm a big fan of what [Hadley Wickham](https://github.com/hadley) is doing with the tidyverse in R. ggplot2 has really improved what I can do w.r.t. graphing and visualising data. As well, I've slowly been picking up [Plotly](https://plot.ly/), to make my visualisations more interactive and user accessible.
